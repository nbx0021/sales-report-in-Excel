# Sales Analytics (FMCG)

## Project Overview

This project involves the creation of two comprehensive sales reports designed to assist the sales team in evaluating customer performance and understanding market dynamics with respect to their targets.

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Hardware, a rapidly expanding consumer electronics company, faced challenges competing with industry leaders due to their reliance on Excel reports. The primary issues included:

- Difficulty in analyzing customer performance and market dynamics effectively.
- Inefficiencies in determining optimal discounts and negotiating with consumers.
- Limited insights into potential business expansion opportunities.

To address these issues, I developed an advanced sales analytics solution using Excel pivot tables to provide actionable insights and recommendations.

## Project Description

In this project, I created a sales report using Excel pivot tables to help businesses:

- **Determine Effective Customer Discounts:** Identify the most impactful discounts to offer.
- **Facilitate Negotiations with Consumers:** Use data-driven insights to negotiate better deals.
- **Identify Business Expansion Opportunities:** Pinpoint promising markets for potential growth.

The reports generated provide actionable insights and recommendations, enabling businesses to optimize their sales strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and maximize revenue generation.

## Key Learnings

Throughout this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

1. **Pivot Tables:** Advanced techniques for summarizing and analyzing data.
2. **Power Query:** Extracting, transforming, and loading data.
3. **DAX (Basics):** Creating custom calculations and aggregations.
4. **Conditional Formatting:** Enhancing report readability and insights.
5. **Report Beautification:** Improving the visual appeal of reports.
6. **Sales Domain Metrics:** Understanding and applying key sales metrics.

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to equip businesses with the tools and insights necessary to monitor, evaluate, and enhance their sales activities. By leveraging detailed sales data analysis, businesses can unlock new opportunities, drive growth, and maintain a competitive edge in the dynamic market landscape.
